### Platforms

| Mobile | Desktop | Other |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Android (+ TV), iOS | Windows, macOS, Linux | Web, Docker |

## Download

Prebuilt binaries for every platform are on the [**releases page**](https://github.com/HamadTheIronside/Driftfin/releases). Platform-specific install and usage notes live in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

**Docker:**
```
ghcr.io/hamadtheironside/driftfin:latest
ghcr.io/hamadtheironside/driftfin-rootless:latest
```

**Web:** [try the hosted web build](https://hamadtheironside.github.io/Driftfin)
> [!NOTE]
> The GitHub-hosted web build only allows `https` connections (a GitHub limitation). Self-hosted web builds work fine over plain `http`.

> [!WARNING]
> On Windows, some Flutter apps are flagged as false positives by Windows Defender. This is a known Flutter/Defender issue, not malware.

## Roadmap

What's planned and in progress lives on the [**Driftfin Roadmap**](https://github.com/users/HamadTheIronside/projects/5). Have an idea? [Open a feature request](https://github.com/HamadTheIronside/Driftfin/issues/new/choose).

## Driftfin Server Plugin (optional)

Driftfin stores its integration settings — Jellyseerr/Overseerr, Sonarr, Radarr
and Trakt — **per user, per device**. The optional **Driftfin Jellyfin plugin**
lets an admin configure those once on the server so every client picks them up
automatically.

**The app works perfectly without it.** With no plugin installed, nothing
changes — each user configures integrations locally as before. The plugin lives
in [`jellyfin-plugin/`](./jellyfin-plugin/) and is built/released separately
from the app.

**What it does**
- Centralizes Seerr/Sonarr/Radarr URLs + API keys and Trakt app credentials.
- Clients fetch the config on login (`GET /Driftfin/Config`). A configured
  integration becomes **read-only** in the app, shown as *"Managed by server"*.
- Per-user secrets stay local: Trakt OAuth tokens and Jellyseerr session
  cookies are still established on each device.

> **Heads-up:** the config endpoint returns the stored values (including API
> keys) to **any logged-in Jellyfin user** — the same trust model Driftfin
> already uses for client-side keys. Don't enable it where untrusted users
> shouldn't see your *.arr keys.

**Set it up**
1. **Install** — build the plugin (see
   [`jellyfin-plugin/README.md`](./jellyfin-plugin/README.md)), then either drop
   the DLL into a `Driftfin` folder under your Jellyfin `plugins/` directory, or
   add a plugin-repository manifest URL in *Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories*
   and install "Driftfin". Restart Jellyfin.
2. **Configure** — open *Dashboard → Plugins → Driftfin* and fill in the
   integrations you want to share, then **Save**.
3. **Use** — Driftfin clients pull the config on the next login; managed fields
   become read-only. Uninstall the plugin to hand control back to each client.

⚠️ The plugin's `targetAbi` must match your Jellyfin server version (defaults to
**10.10.x**). See [`jellyfin-plugin/README.md`](./jellyfin-plugin/README.md).

## Contributing

Interested in contributing? A few ways to help:

**🐛 Reporting bugs**
- Check that the issue hasn't already been [reported](https://github.com/HamadTheIronside/Driftfin/issues).
- Include clear, detailed steps to reproduce — it makes fixing the bug much faster.

**🚀 Pull requests**
- For new features or large changes, open an issue first so work isn't duplicated.
- Keep PRs short and focused — avoid bundling unrelated fixes.
- **Tests are required**: every bugfix and new feature must include unit and widget tests (`test/`, `*_test.dart`). CI runs `flutter test` on every PR and must pass.

**🌐 Translations**
- Translations live in `lib/l10n/app_*.arb`. Edit the relevant file (keys are defined in `app_en.arb`) and open a PR.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [DEVELOPEMENT.md](./DEVELOPEMENT.md) for setup and full guidelines.
